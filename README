Whisperscope is a tool for scraping textual data out of languages with
C-style comments, and provides basic autodocumentation functionality
targeting Sphinx.

It makes absolutely no assumptions about the structure of your code
whatsoever, and serves simply as a means of pulling markdown out of
comments and dumping it into Sphinx.  Works great for performing
autodocumentation on JavaScript projects.

Whisperscope does no syntax checking beyond comment recognition, so it
could theoretically be used for a lot of things.  Because of this, you
can also use it as a python module.
.
