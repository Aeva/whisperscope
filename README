Whjsper is a tool that facilitates automatic documentation of
JavaScript files.

It makes absolutely no assumptions about your code whatsoever, and
serves as a means of pulling markdown out of javascript files and
dumping it into Sphinx.

Whjsper doesn't do *any* syntax checking whatsoever, so it could
theoretically be used with a lot of things.
